Description: Open vSwitch datapath module source - module-assistant version
 Open vSwitch is a production quality, multilayer, software-based,
 Ethernet virtual switch. It is designed to enable massive network
 automation through programmatic extension, while still supporting
 standard management interfaces and protocols (e.g. NetFlow, IPFIX,
 sFlow, SPAN, RSPAN, CLI, LACP, 802.1ag). In addition, it is designed
 to support distribution across multiple physical servers similar to
 VMware's vNetwork distributed vswitch or Cisco's Nexus 1000V.
 .
 This package provides the Open vSwitch datapath module source code
 that is needed by openvswitch-switch.  The kernel module can be built
 from it using module-assistant or make-kpkg.  README.Debian in this
 package provides further instructions.
