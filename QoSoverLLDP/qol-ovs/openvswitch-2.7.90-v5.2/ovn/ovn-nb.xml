    This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system
    (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it.  The CMS produces almost all of
    the contents of the database.  The <code>ovn-northd</code> program
    monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the <ref
    db="OVN_Southbound"/> database.

    We generally speak of ``the'' CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
    which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment.

  <h2>External IDs</h2>

    Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named

      There are two kinds of logical switches, that is, ones that fully
      virtualize the network (overlay logical switches) and ones that provide
      simple connectivity to a physical network (bridged logical switches).
      They work in the same way when providing connectivity between logical
      ports on same chasis, but differently when connecting remote logical
      ports.  Overlay logical switches connect remote logical ports by tunnels,
      while bridged logical switches provide connectivity to remote ports by
      bridging the packets to directly connected physical L2 segment with the
      help of <code>localnet</code> ports.  Each bridged logical switch has
      one and only one <code>localnet</code> port, which has only one special

      <p>
        When a large number of containers are nested within a VM, it may be too
        expensive to dedicate a VIF to each container.  OVN can use VLAN tags
        to support such cases.  Each container is assigned a VLAN ID and each
        packet that passes between the hypervisor and the VM is tagged with the
        appropriate ID for the container.  Such VLAN IDs never appear on a
        physical wire, even inside a tunnel, so they need not be unique except
        relative to a single VM on a hypervisor.
      </p>

      <p>
        These columns are used for VIFs that represent nested containers using
        shared VIFs.  For VMs and for containers that have dedicated VIFs, they
        are empty.
      </p>

      <column name="parent_name">
        The VM interface through which the nested container sends its network

          The VLAN tag in the network traffic associated with a container's

          to allocate a tag that is unique within the scope of a specific
          parent (specified in <ref column="parent_name"/>) by setting a value
          of <code>0</code> in this column.  The allocated value is written
          by <code>ovn-northd</code> in the <ref column="tag"/> column.
          (Note that these tags are allocated and managed locally in
          <code>ovn-northd</code>, so they cannot be reconstructed in the event
          that the database is lost.)  The client can also request a specific
          non-zero tag and <code>ovn-northd</code> will honor it and copy that
          value to the <ref column="tag"/> column.

        to a physical location in the OVN Southbound database <ref

        sets this column to <code>true</code>; otherwise, or if the port

      </column>

      <column name="enabled">
        This column is used to administratively set port state.  If this column

          Addresses owned by the logical port.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each element in the set must take one of the following forms:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><code>Ethernet address followed by zero or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses (or both)</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              An Ethernet address defined is owned by the logical port.
              Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has
              a single fixed Ethernet address.
            </p>

            <p>
              When a OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame
              whose destination MAC address is in a logical port's <ref
              column="addresses"/> column, it delivers it only to that port, as
              if a MAC learning process had learned that MAC address on the
              port.
            </p>

            <p>
              If IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) (or both) are defined, it indicates
              that the logical port owns the given IP addresses.
            </p>

            <p>
              If IPv4 address(es) are defined, the OVN logical switch uses this
              information to synthesize responses to ARP requests without
              traversing the physical network. The OVN logical router connected
              to the logical switch, if any, uses this information to avoid
              issuing ARP requests for logical switch ports.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that the order here is important. The Ethernet address must
              be listed before the IP address(es) if defined.
            </p>

              <dd>
                This indicates that the logical port owns the mac address and

          <dd>
            This indicates that the logical port has an unknown set of Ethernet

            frame whose destination MAC address is not in any logical port's
            <ref column="addresses"/> column, it delivers it to the port (or

              The keyword <code>dynamic</code> after the MAC address indicates
              that <code>ovn-northd</code> should choose an unused IPv4 address
              from the logical port's subnet and store it with the specified
              MAC in the port's <ref column="dynamic_addresses"/> column.

                This indicates that the logical port owns the specified
                MAC address and <code>ovn-northd</code> should allocate an
                unused IPv4 address for the logical port from the corresponding
                logical switch subnet.

          This column controls the addresses from which the host attached to the

          is allowed to receive packets.  If this column is empty, all addresses
          are permitted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each element in the set must begin with one Ethernet address.
          This would restrict the host to sending packets from and receiving
          packets to the ethernet addresses defined in the logical port's
          <ref column="port_security"/> column. It also restricts the inner
          source MAC addresses that the host may send in ARP and IPv6
          Neighbor Discovery packets. The host is always allowed to receive packets
          to multicast and broadcast Ethernet addresses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each element in the set may additionally contain one or more IPv4 or
          IPv6 addresses (or both), with optional masks.  If a mask is given, it
          must be a CIDR mask.  In addition to the restrictions described for
          Ethernet addresses above, such an element restricts the IPv4 or IPv6
          addresses from which the host may send and to which it may receive
          packets to the specified addresses.  A masked address, if the host part
          is zero, indicates that the host is allowed to use any address in the
          subnet; if the host part is nonzero, the mask simply indicates the size
          of the subnet. In addition:

              IPv4 multicast addresses (224.0.0.0/4).  If an IPv4 address with a

              broadcast address in that specified subnet.
            </p>

            <p>
              If any IPv4 address is given, the host is additionally restricted
              to sending ARP packets with the specified source IPv4 address.
              (RARP is not restricted.)

            <p>
              If any IPv6 address is given, the host is additionally restricted

          If an element includes an IPv4 address, but no IPv6 addresses, then

          <dd>
            This adds further restrictions to the first example.  The host may
            send IPv4 packets from or receive IPv4 packets to only 192.168.1.10,
            except that it may also receive IPv4 packets to 192.168.1.255 (based

            The host may not send ARPs with a source Ethernet address other than
            80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 or source IPv4 address other than 192.168.1.10.
            The host may not send or receive any IPv6 (including IPv6 Neighbor
            Discovery) traffic.

          <dd>
            The host may send traffic from and receive traffic to the
            specified MAC addresses, and
            to receive traffic to Ethernet multicast and broadcast addresses,
            but not otherwise.   With MAC 80:fa:5b:12:42:ba, the host may
            send traffic from and receive traffic to any L3 address.
            With MAC 80:fa:5b:06:72:b7, the host may send IPv4 packets from or
            receive IPv4 packets to only 192.168.1.10, except that it may also
            receive IPv4 packets to 192.168.1.255 (based on the subnet mask),
            255.255.255.255, and any address in 224.0.0.0/4.  The host may not
