.TH ovs\-tcpdump 8 "@VERSION@" "Open vSwitch" "Open vSwitch Manual"
.
.SH NAME
ovs\-tcpdump \- Dump traffic from an Open vSwitch port using \fBtcpdump\fR.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBovs\-tcpdump\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIport\fR \fBtcpdump options...\fR
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBovs\-tcpdump\fR creates switch mirror ports in the \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR
daemon and executes \fBtcpdump\fR to listen against those ports. When the
\fBtcpdump\fR instance exits, it then cleans up the mirror port it created.
.PP
\fBovs\-tcpdump\fR will not allow multiple mirrors for the same port. It has
some logic to parse the current configuration and prevent duplicate mirrors.
.PP
The \fB\-i\fR option may not appear multiple times.
.PP
It is important to note that under \fBLinux\fR based kernels, tap devices do
not receive packets unless the specific tuntap device has been opened by an
application. This requires \fBCAP_NET_ADMIN\fR privileges, so the
\fBovs-tcpdump\fR command must be run as a user with such permissions (this
is usually a super-user).
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
